      <h3>What the Data Maps are about</h3>

      <p>These maps exist to give a high-level summary of what data we deal
      with, where it's stored, how it's represented, and how it's processed.</p>

      <p>By a "high-level summary", we mean that fine technical details aren't
      included on the Map - they would just clutter it, and confuse most
      readers. However, by indicating where the data is stored in databases, the
      Physical Databases map gives a reader seeking those technical details
      directions to where those details can be found. There's no point in
      duplicating precise details of schemas, when it's easy enough to go to the
      actual database and take a look.</p>

      <p>To give a longer justification for the things we DO record:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Logical Objects</dt>
        <dd>Logical Objects are the real-world "things" we care about - people, courses, applications, schools, that sort of thing.</dd>

        <dt>Logical Object Links</dt>
        <dd>We also record <em>links</em> between logical objects. For instance,
        an ITT application involves a Person who is applying, a Course they are
        applying for, and so on. Therefore, we say there are links from the "ITT
        Application" logical object to "Person", "Course", and so on.</dd>

        <dt>Physical Databases</dt>
        <dd>A physical database is an actual database containing data, somewhere
        within the DfE's infrastructure. We give the name of the database, but
        not precise details like connection strings - that information might be
        a bit security sensitive, and it's not too hard to find somebody who can
        hook you up with connection details to a database if you know what it's
        called.</dd>

        <dt>Database Synchronisations</dt>
        <dd>We often duplicate data between databases, for a number of
        reasons. It's important to know when data is duplicated - and, most
        importantly, which is the "original" data and which is the (possibly
        outdated) duplicate. Therefore, all processes that duplicate data
        between databases without any significant processing/alteration are
        listed.</dd>

        <dt>Representations</dt>
        <dd>Tables in a physical database contain data about real-world logical
        objects; we can say that the data in the databases <em>represents</em>
        those objects in our databases. This is the link between those physical
        databases and the logical objects, so we document it to enable people to
        navigate between them. At the simplest level, we just record that
        information about a given object is present in a given database; but
        where possible, we also record which table in the database holds that
        information, and what identifying fields there are (ranging from nice
        unique IDs to "fuzzy" or optional identifiers like an email
        address).</dd>

        <dt>Actors</dt>
        <dd>We also record what things <em>use</em> data; actors include
        services, organisations, and other systems. Sometimes an actor's use of
        a database is indirect, because an actor (such as a user-facing service)
        uses another actor (such as an internal API service) that actually uses
        the data, so we also record where actors use other actors to access
        data.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>I found a mistake / I know something relevant that's not in the maps!</h3>

      <p>These maps are like Wikipedia - they're a community effort. Please see
      the <a href="#how-to-edit">instructions below on how to submit
      improvements to them</a>!</p>

      <h3>How complete and detailed should the maps be?</h3>

      <p>The maps should provide a high-level summary of what's going on with data.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>They should not contain detailed technical schemas of databases</dt>
        <dd>Instead, they should summarise the contents of a database at the
        level of "It contains information about people and schools"; people who
        need finer detail should go and talk to the team that maintains the
        database.</dd>

        <dt>They should not contain details only of interest within a service team</dt>
        <dd>For instance, if a services uses a Redis instance to cache
        information, that doesn't need to be documented on the data maps because
        that's probably not interesting to people outside of that service
        team.</dd>

        <dt>They should not duplicate other resources (too much)</dt>
        <dd>Mostly, these maps are intended to share information that's
        currently only in people's heads. Where useful information exists in
        other places, particularly if it's more detailed, then this map should
        just be used to find those other resources. However, that's not to say
        duplication is forbidden here - these maps will often contain summaries
        of more detailed information, bringing together those summaries from
        multiple sources to provide a combined map that doesn't exist as a whole
        in any other form.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>How up to date and complete are the maps?</h3>

      <p>As of 2022-03-10, the maps are mainly the work of one person, so only
      contain detail they have encountered in their few months at DfE. Please
      contribute further information and corrections if you know anything that's
      not represented.</p>

      <h3>Who do I ask for more information about something?</h3>

      <p>We haven't included contact information for who the experts are on
      particular things on the map. This is purely because it's pretty easy to
      find teams in Slack, and actors/physical databases tend to be named after
      teams, so that's probably redundant information. However, if it would be
      helpful, we can include some kind of contact directory in the map.</p>

      <h3 id="how-to-edit">How to edit the Data Maps</h3>

      <p>The Data Maps are contained in the <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/bat-data-maps">bat-data-maps GitHub repo</a>; see the repo's `README` for details on how to edit the map. Please submit pull requests with your proposed changes, and we (the Data Insights Team) will merge them for you.</p>
