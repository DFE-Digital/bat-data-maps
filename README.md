Herein lies attempts to map logical and physical data models at DfE

## Goals

1. A "logical" data model: a model of the real-world/problem-domain objects and how they relate.

2. A "physical" data model: a model of what data repositories we have and what
   aspects of the real-world objects are stored in each, and how the data flows
   between them work.

## Plan

Initially develop the maps in [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) format, for ease of adding stuff.

When it's stable we can think about manually laying the diagrams out to make them clearer.
